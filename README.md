That's a very common issue! The most likely reason the images are not loading is that you are viewing the README.md file locally in a text editor or IDE.

Most local Markdown previews block external internet requests for security reasons. The images (like your GitHub Stats and the badges) are not stored in your project; they are loaded live from the internet.

Once you push this file to your GitHub repository, the images will load correctly when you view the repository on GitHub.com.

However, I have updated the README file to use shields.io for all the social icons, which is a more modern, consistent, and reliable method than using the old simple-icons CDN. This will look more professional and standardized.
