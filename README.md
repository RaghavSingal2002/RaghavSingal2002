This is a great foundation. You have excellent, results-driven content for your projects and experience.

I've updated your README to be more dynamic, professional, and visually scannable for recruiters. I focused on:

A Stronger "Above the Fold": A new intro and a high-visibility link bar for your key socials.

A Critical Fix: Your portfolio link (127.0.0.1) was a local address, meaning no one else could see it. I've replaced it with a placeholder for your live, deployed URL.

Better Structure: I've reorganized your tech stack into collapsible, categorized sections. This is much cleaner and more impressive.

Refined Formatting: I've applied standard Markdown formatting to your projects and experience to make them easier to read.

Professional Polish: I've rephrased some sections to be more active and confident.

Here is the updated README.md file.
